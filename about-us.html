        <h3>Andrew Conklin</h3>
        <div id="andrew-bio" class="bio">Raised in a military family, <a href="https://andrewconklin.com/"> Andrew's</a> nomadic childhood nurtured his visionary spirit and entrepreneurial drive. A passion for music production and social media ignited at age 12, leading him to amass millions of online impressions by 16. This early success propelled his entry into the music industry, where he provided marketing services that helped several songs achieve multi-platinum status. Around this time he met Chris and their close bond inspired the co-founding of Soleil Pictures years later. Beyond art, he tackles scientific and engineering challenges, having developed a method for carbon-negative cement production. Andrew's relentless drive, combined with his unique blend of business and creative talents, positions him as a powerful force in filmmaking.</div>
