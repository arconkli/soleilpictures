A passion for music production and social media ignited at age <time datetime="P12Y">12</time>, leading him to amass millions of online impressions by <time datetime="P16Y">16</time>. This early success propelled his entry into the music industry, where he provided marketing services that helped several songs achieve multi-platinum status. Around this time he met <strong>Chris</strong> and their close bond inspired the co-founding of <strong>Soleil Pictures</strong> years later. Beyond art, he tackles scientific and engineering challenges, having developed a method for carbon-negative cement production. Andrew's relentless drive, combined with his unique blend of business and creative talents, positions him as a powerful force in filmmaking.</p>
