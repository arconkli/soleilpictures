-- 0170 — Extend admin_referral_stats with the conversion-gated paid reward
-- (0167) numbers + a viral coefficient, so the operator can see whether sharing
-- actually converts. Pure aggregation over the referrals ledger; same signature,
-- safe CREATE OR REPLACE. Existing fields reproduced verbatim (drift-aware).
--
-- New fields: referring_users, paid_conversions (referred friends who paid),
-- months_granted, k_factor (activated referrals ÷ referring users — >1 is
-- self-sustaining), median_days_to_activate; top_referrers gains friends_paid.
-- Applied to PROD via Supabase MCP (`referral_stats_paid_and_kfactor`).
