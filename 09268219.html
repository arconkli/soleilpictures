        <p><strong>Logline:</strong> After stealing a time machine, a reckless drunk juggles trying to (literally)
            live with his past self while going on adventures throughout time.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong>After breaking up with his girlfriend, Maria, Moe Miller goes into a drunken
            spiral that leads him to a time machine from an alien organization. He
            unknowingly travels back and accidentally finds his 26-year-old self, Frankie
            Miller. Before having time to fully process what was going on they get sent
            into a spiral of adventures throughout time needing to escape the now
            furious alien organization Moe stole the time machine from. Along the way,
            their relationship goes through very intense trials and tribulations as Moe
            gets reminded about who he was and Frankie canâ€™t fathom who he will one
            day be. History tends to be littered with interesting characters and these
            two can't seem to catch a break. They constantly run into plenty of good,
            bad, and morally ambiguous people, forming relationships that may or may
            
            not affect them later down the road.
